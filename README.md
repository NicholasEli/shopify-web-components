# s-snax

A collection of **opinionated, production-ready Web Components** that extend Shopify’s official Web Component library.

This repository exists to fill **gaps in the current Shopify Web Components / Polaris component set**, providing UI primitives and interaction patterns that are commonly needed in real Shopify apps but are not yet available upstream.

All components are designed to:

- Work seamlessly inside **Shopify Admin** and **Shopify embedded apps**
- Follow **Polaris visual and interaction patterns**
- Be framework-agnostic (React, Vue, plain JS, etc.)
- Use modern Web APIs (Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, Pointer Events)
